# Who is this guy?

Platform Engineering Manager for a SaaS Platform at DXC Technology Spain.

# :unamused:

---

# Who is this guy? Again?

Basically, I am a techie.

# :sweat:

---

# What have we learnt in 10 years?
Software Architecture is like pasta.

# :spaghetti:

# Fact-checking time!
This is what we were talking about 10 years ago

# 1. Layered Monolith (Lasagna)
<Box

>
 Service Oriented Architectures. Overengineering.
</Box>

Hundreds of integration patterns and solutions. Contract based. 

---

# Service Oriented Architectures (SOA)
Hype during mid 2000s. The pattern was OK but products killed it

Focus on heavy products and Enterpise Infrastructures. _Smart Pipelines_

--- 

# The Technology: Transactional
- JavaEE + Struts + XML

- Web Services (SOAP) + EJB 

- Tibco + BPMs + ESBs + Oracle 

---

# 2. Microservices (Ravioli)
<Box
  bg='cyan'
  p={4}
  fontSize={48}
  color='black'
  css={{
    fontWeight:'bold'
  }}
>
 Self-contained functionality. Light-weight communication
</Box>

Focus on business capabilities and independently deployable

---

# Microservices Architecture
It's a decomposition pattern. Breaking the monolith systems

You need a lot of maturity, agility and automation. _Smart Endpoints_

# :hatching_chick:

---

<Image src="images/microservices.png" size="70%" />

---

# The Technology: Conversational
- Single Page Apps (SPAs) in Angular or React or Vue

- REST APIs

- Node.js + NoSQL Databases

---

# MEAN Stack
MongoDB. Express. Angular. Node.js

Comunicating with REST APIs via JSON. JavaScript _everywhere_

# :dancer:

---

# REST APIs
An API is a User Interface. It just happens that the user is another machine!

Focus on the business problem and domain data. _Domain Driven Design_

# :facepunch:
---

# RESTful Architectures

1. Everything is REpresented as a Resource​

2. Resources have State​

3. Resource State is Transferred fully leveraging HTTP (only)

--- 

# Wait a minute! ​

If everything is a resource and we are using the Web then …

everything in REST is just a web page, right?​

# :hushed:

---

# YES
Hypermedia as the engine of application

Resource Model = Class Diagram. Relationships are _links_

Represented in JSON: HAL (resources) and JSON Hyperschema (schemas)

---

# Benefits of REST(ing)

- Louse Coupling
- API Economy
- SaaS

---

# 3. SaaS: Software as a Service

 Digital Transformation of Software
</Box>

From Software to Services. From Product to Platform

# :wave: Licenses :wave:

---

# Digital Platforms
## The Importance of the Community
- Every new digital platform is making their APIs public

- Co-Innovate and co-create with external developers

# :walking:

---

# 4. Open Source

 "We release it because it is good and we think it can be better"
</Box>

Who is the biggest Open Source Contributor in the world?

# GitHub
_It is not a code repository. It is a revolutionary Software Engineering Platform_

- GitFlow
- Fork
- Pull Requests
- Inner-sourcing

---

# Work on your GitHub Proifile
It is about online reputation. 

Architects do have GitHub profiles.

# :heart:

---

# Really?
Yes. And they still code

Don't confuse a Software Architect with a Solution Architect

# :scream:

# In case you don't believe it ...

# Developers are the New Rock Stars 
It's a craft

# :guitar:
--- 

# Everything can be treated as code
- Platform as Code
- Networking as Code
- Infrastructure as Code
- Documentation as Code
- Security as Code.


- Even this presentation is Code!

---

# Low-Code Platforms
Just pay attention and be skeptic

Yes, I am very opinionated!

# :poop:

---

# Developer Portals
Co-Innovate and co-create in a Digital Innovation Platform

Ecosystems: We can't do everything alone

# :muscle:

Spinning up infrastructure and applications from voice commands

# :no_mouth:

---

# Distributed Ledgers
Peer to peer computing

Blockchain.

# :cold_sweat:

---

# Functional Programming
Scala. Elm. Clojure ... JavaScript.

If favours collaboration in Open Source projects!

# :flushed:

---

# Languages and Tools
WebAssembley

Rust

# :confused:

---

# Artificial Intelligence
Machine Learning

Machine Teaching

# :rage:

---

# New Development Stacks?
**SAFE Stack**: _End-to-end functional programming stack_

**TICK Stack**: _End-to-end data processing programming stack_

# :confounded:

--- 

# The role of the architect
- Automation pipelines
- Coding for the Cloud using new stacks
- Design of distributed systems
